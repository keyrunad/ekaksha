			eKaksha is a platform for conducting online class in such a manner that users (students) can learn anything of their interest at any time and from anywhere. Here we intend to create virtual classrooms where the teachers can teach their students located at a remote location. This helps students to learn about new topics from anywhere at any time, all they need is internet.
Students no longer have to completely rely on their lectures or only a single teacher for what are willing to learn. They can learn about a single topic from multiple tutors and also multiple topics from a single teacher.
eKaksha helps to establish communication among teachers and students all the time which is not possible in school and colleges. This web-application is very much suitable for our country as it overcomes the geographical challenges of Nepal.
